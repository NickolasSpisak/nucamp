Nick Spisak's React Nucamp Project

This React app was created in fall of 2021 during my time 
in the Nucamp Bootcamp.

This App is completed and no new commits will be added to it.

This application features several interactive components such as campsites and their information changing when a user clicks,
redux to store certain pieces of information, and middleware for the loading screens. I hope to use this application as a first step for
my future projects to build off of and improve.
